# Lab 3: GEV Inference

**Date:** September 12, 2025 | **Module:** 1 | **Week:** 3

## Overview

This lab introduces students to extreme value theory parameter estimation using both modern Bayesian methods and traditional approaches. Students will implement GEV parameter estimation with Turing.jl, benchmark against established methods with Extremes.jl, and learn to quantify uncertainty in return level estimates.

## Topics Covered

- GEV parameter estimation with Turing.jl
- Benchmarking with traditional methods using Extremes.jl
- Confidence intervals for return levels
- Uncertainty quantification in extreme value analysis
- Comparing Bayesian and frequentist approaches

## Objectives

- Implement GEV parameter estimation using Turing.jl
- Compare results with traditional methods using Extremes.jl
- Calculate confidence intervals for return levels
- Understand the importance of uncertainty quantification in extreme events

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab provides the GEV fitting tools and uncertainty quantification methods that students will need for PS1 Task 1, establishing the statistical foundation for rainfall frequency analysis.
